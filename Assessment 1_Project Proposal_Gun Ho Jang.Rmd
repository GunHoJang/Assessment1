## Research Question

As rising cost of living has garnered increased attention over recent years due to inflationary pressures on the price of food and energy (<https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/09/cost-of-living-crisis-global-impact/>, <https://theconversation.com/global-economy-2023-how-countries-around-the-world-are-tackling-the-cost-of-living-crisis-196740>), a large number of people are becoming increasingly vulnerable to food affordability issues. In this project, I will be investigating this issue: how much of the global population is at risk of not affording a healthy diet?

## Dataset Introduction

Data for this project was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/food-prices) under the Food Prices Data Explorer in the Food Prices insight, which in turn derived its data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Bank (<https://ourworldindata.org/food-prices>). Three different datasets were used for this project:

-   [Number of people that cannot afford a healthy diet](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/food-prices?Diet=Healthy+diet&Cost+or+Affordability=Affordability&Affordability+metric=Number+that+cannot+afford&Cost+metric=%25+of+average+food+expenditure&country=NGA~BGD~IND~ETH~MEX~USA~BRA~GBR)

-   [Share of population that cannot afford a healthy diet](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/food-prices?Diet=Healthy+diet&Cost+or+Affordability=Affordability&Affordability+metric=Share+that+cannot+afford&Cost+metric=%25+of+average+food+expenditure&country=NGA~BGD~IND~ETH~MEX~USA~BRA~GBR)

-   [Cost of a healthy diet as a share of average expenditure on food](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/food-prices?Diet=Healthy+diet&Cost+or+Affordability=Cost+&Affordability+metric=Share+that+cannot+afford&Cost+metric=%25+of+average+food+expenditure&country=NGA~BGD~IND~ETH~MEX~USA~BRA~GBR)

I will be observing the most recent year (i.e. 2021) that data is readily available for the variables of interest in this project.

The variables of interest *Number of people that cannot afford a healthy diet* and *Share of population that cannot afford a healthy diet* will be looking at both the number and percentage share of a country's population that cannot afford a healthy diet, where: "The cost of a healthy diet is the lowest-cost set of foods available that would meet requirements in dietary guidelines from governments and public health agencies. A diet is defined as unaffordable when its cost, plus basic non-food needs like housing and transportation, exceeds daily income" (<https://ourworldindata.org/food-prices>).

Regarding the third variable *Cost of a healthy diet as a share of average expenditure on food*, it observes the cost of a healthy diet as represented as a ratio against a person's average food expenditure in a particular country.

```{r variable names}
# LIsting the variable names
variable_names <- data.frame(
  Variable_Names = c(
  "Country",
  "Continent",
  "Number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet",
  "Share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet",
  "Affordability of a healthy diet: ratio of cost to food expenditures"
))

kable(variable_names, caption = "Variable Names of Interest")
```

## Dataset Description

The  R code chunk below demonstrates the cleaning of the data in order to be fit for analytical purposes.

```{r data set cleaning, message = FALSE}
# Reading individual CSV files into respective dataframes
number_healthy_diet <- read.csv("Data/number-healthy-diet-unaffordable.csv")

share_healthy_diet <- read.csv("Data/share-healthy-diet-unaffordable.csv")

cost_healthy_diet <- read.csv("Data/cost-healthy-diet-share-food-expenditure.csv")

# Filtering the data for most recent year available and selecting the relevant columns
number_healthy_diet_2021 <- number_healthy_diet %>% 
  filter(Year == 2021) %>% 
  select(Entity, 4)

share_healthy_diet_2021 <- share_healthy_diet %>% 
  filter(Year == 2021) %>% 
  select(Entity, 4)

cost_healthy_diet_2021 <- cost_healthy_diet %>% 
  filter(Year == 2021) %>% 
  select(Entity, 4)

# Merging dataframes based on Entity variable (i.e. Name of Country)
food_affordability_data <- number_healthy_diet_2021 %>%
  left_join(share_healthy_diet_2021, by = "Entity") %>% 
  left_join(cost_healthy_diet_2021, by = "Entity")

# Renaming Entity variable to 'Country' and cleaning header names to introduce spacing

food_affordability_data <- food_affordability_data %>% 
  rename(Country = Entity,
         `Number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet` = Number.of.people.who.cannot.afford.a.healthy.diet,
         `Share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet` = Share.of.the.population.who.cannot.afford.a.healthy.diet,
    `Affordability of a healthy diet: ratio of cost to food expenditures` = Affordability.of.a.healthy.diet..ratio.of.cost.to.food.expenditures
         )

# Removing invalid entries under 'Country' variable
invalid_country_entries <-  c("East Asia & Pacific (WB)", 
                              "Europe & Central Asia (WB)",
                              "High-income countries",
                              "Latin America & Caribbean (WB)",
                              "Low-income countries",
                              "Lower-middle-income countries",
                              "Middle East & North Africa (WB)",
                              "North America (WB)",
                              "South Asia (WB)",
                              "Sub-Saharan Africa (WB)",
                              "Upper-middle-income countries",
                              "World")

food_affordability_data <- food_affordability_data %>% 
  filter(!Country %in% invalid_country_entries)

# Re-grouping countries by their Continents using the 'countrycode' package
food_affordability_data <- food_affordability_data %>% 
  mutate(
    Continent = countrycode(Country, origin = "country.name", destination = "continent")
    )

# Re-arranging the variables columns
food_affordability_data <- food_affordability_data %>% 
  select(Country, Continent, everything())

```

```{r number of observations and variables, echo = FALSE}
# Calculating the number of observations and variables

num_observations <- nrow(food_affordability_data)
num_variables <- ncol(food_affordability_data)
```

The data set regarding the affordability of healthy diets contains `r num_observations` observations and `r num_variables` variables. Please note the code to derive the number of observations and variables is, as below:

```{r screenshot, echo = FALSE}
# Implementing the screenshot into the project
include_graphics("Image/Number of Observations and Variables Screenshot.png")
```

As observed below, the first two rows of the data set can be displayed with `str()` to showcase the type of variables within the data set.

```{r first two rows, echo = FALSE}
# Displaying the first two rows of the data set
str(food_affordability_data[1:2,])
```

## Data Summary

```{r data summary}
# Summary statistics for 'Number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet' and 'Affordability of a healthy diet: ratio of cost to food expenditures'
data_summary <- food_affordability_data %>% 
  group_by(Continent) %>% 
  summarise(
    Sum_Number = sum(`Number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Number = mean(`Number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Sum_Share = sum(`Share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Share = sum(`Share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  head(10)

kable(data_summary, caption = "Summary statistics of the 'Number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet' and 'Share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet' variables")

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
